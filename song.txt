Taste the love
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb
You feel what it does and you're drunk on love
You're sleeping in the fire

I gaze as the flame and fire burn
And cry out the name of which I yearn

Taste the love
The Lucifer's magic that makes you numb
The passion and all the pain are one
You're sleeping in the fire
